//Set up value to target adding and removing divs
Create multiple image divs that get turned on and off depending
i.e function for each
and nested div values with if-else functions?

Create baseline positioning
All that has to happen is div getting turned on and off
Set up styling in "wait"

If functions relatively simple - value just has to be greater than a certain value
